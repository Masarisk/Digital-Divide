                <p>The Central African Republic (CAR) is the country in which the digital divide is most prominent, characterized by an extremely low internet penetration rate (11%) as of 2024. With limited infrastructure development about broadband access and high costs of internet access relative to income, connectivity remains a challenge, particularly in rural and remote areas within the CAR. This internet disparity, coupled with the notably low number of the population that has access to a computer (<1%), significantly impacts education, economic opportunities, and social connectivity within the country. Students struggle to access online educational resources, hindering their learning. In addition, small businesses face obstacles in accessing online markets, constraining economic growth and entrepreneurship. Socially, the lack of internet connectivity isolates communities within the CAR from the global community, hindering communication with friends, family, and diaspora communities.</p>
